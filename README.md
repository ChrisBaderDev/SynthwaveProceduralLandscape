# Procedural Landscape

## Description
This is a sketch inspired by Daniel Shiffman's procedural landscape video. 
It uses a mesh with a heightmap, which is generated by perlin Noise and shifted along 
the y-axis to generate the illusion of movement. Additionally, there is a Sun, 
which is a sphere mesh with point lights.

Here's how it looks at the moment:
